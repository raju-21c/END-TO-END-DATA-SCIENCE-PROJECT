##  *I performed END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT. I used python 3.13.This code can be able to run in idle python 3.13 after installing pip and downloading modules.The primary modules used in the script are from the  pandas numpy scikit-learn Flask joblib.This sounds like a great project! I'll guide you through developing a full data science project, from data collection and preprocessing to deploying a machine learning model using Flask. For this example, we'll build a House Price Prediction mode *
